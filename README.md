# LiCam â€“ Intelligent Pothole Detection and Alert System  

**LiCam** is an advanced pothole detection and driver alert system powered by a **camera (YOLOv8)** and **2D LiDAR**.  
- In well-lit conditions, the camera ensures precise pothole detection using YOLOv8.  
- In low-light or night-time scenarios, 2D LiDAR depth data is utilized for reliable detection.  
- The system provides **real-time voice instructions**, guiding drivers to safely avoid potholes and maneuver efficiently.  

This dual-sensor fusion guarantees **accurate detection and immediate alerts**, even under challenging visibility conditions.
